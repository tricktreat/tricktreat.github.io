## About Me


I am an assistant professor (ZJU-100 Young Professor) at Zhejiang University. I received my Ph.D. degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2024, supervised by Prof. [Yueting Zhuang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yzhuang). My research interests include large language models, AI agents and knowledge graph. I am a member of [DCD Lab](#) and worked closely with Prof. [Weiming Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H42slBQAAAAJ&hl=en).
From 2021 to 2022, I was a research intern at [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/), mentored by Xiaobin Wang and [Yong Jiang](https://jiangyong.site/). 
From 2022 to 2023, I was a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn), mentored by [Kaitao Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LLk9dR8AAAAJ) and [Xu Tan](https://tan-xu.github.io/).

## Research Interests

- **Large Language Models**, especially on the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, planning, and execution, focusing on the controllability, interpretability, and efficiency of LLMs. Self-reflective, self-improving and self-evolving LLMs are also of interest.
- **AI Agents**, especially on [autonomous agents]((https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/)), multi-agent systems, and human-agent collaboration, focusing on the abilities of agents for reasoning, decision-making, and interaction.
- **Multimodel Learning**, especially on multimodal pretraining and multimodal reasoning, focusing on the fusion of vision and language.
- **Knowledge Computing**, especially on the colaboration of external knowledge and large language models, focusing on the knowledge reasoning and evolution.
